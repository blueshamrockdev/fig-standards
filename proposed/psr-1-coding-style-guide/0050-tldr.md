tl;dr
=====

- Use only `<?php` and `<?=` opening tags for PHP code; leave out the closing
  `?>` tag when the file contains only PHP code.

- Line length limit is 80 characters; use 4 spaces for indenting, not tabs;
  no white space at the end of lines.

- Namespace all classes, functions, and constants; place one blank line after
  the `namespace` line, and one blank line after the `use` block.

- Declare namespace and class names in `StudlyCase`.

- Opening braces for classes, methods, and functions go on the next line; all
  other opening braces go on the same line, and closing braces go on their own
  line.

- Expressly "no recommendation" on variable and property names.

- Declare function and method names in `camelCase()`.

- Always declare visibility on methods and properties.

- Control structure keywords have a space after them; no space after the 
  opening parenthesis, no space before the closing parenthesis; always use
  braces even when not strictly needed.
