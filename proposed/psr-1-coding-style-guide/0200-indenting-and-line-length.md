Indenting and Line Length
=========================

Use an indent of 4 spaces; do not use tabs. The use of spaces helps to avoid problems with diffs, patches, history, and annotations, and provides fine-grained sub-indentation when aligning elements on consecutive lines.

Lines should be limited to 75-85 characters in length. This is in deference to human cognitive limitations, not the limitations of screens or editors.
