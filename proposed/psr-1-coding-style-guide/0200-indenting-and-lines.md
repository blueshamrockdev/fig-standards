Indenting and Lines
===================


Indenting
---------

Use an indent of 4 spaces. Do not use tabs. The use of spaces helps to avoid
problems with diffs, patches, history, and annotations, and provides
fine-grained sub-indentation for inter-line alignment.


Line Length
-----------

There is no hard limit on line length. The soft limit on line length is 120
characters; automated style checkers should warn but not error at the soft
limit. This guide strongly encourages lines no longer than 80 characters, and
encourages splitting longer lines into multiple subsequent lines of no more
than 80 characters each.


Line Endings
------------

Use the Unix LF (linefeed) line ending on all PHP files.

Do not add trailing spaces at the end of lines.


Blank Lines
-----------

Blank lines may be added to improve readability and to indicate related blocks of logic.
